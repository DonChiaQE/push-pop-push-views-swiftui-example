# push-pop-push-views-swiftui-example

This is an example for programmatically navigating between three different views using SwiftUI navigation links.

I personally had difficulty looking for such an example and hence I created a small repo example. 

The root view is displayed first and on the click of the button in the root view, a second view is pushed. The second view features another button that will pop itself and push a third view over the root view.
